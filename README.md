# TO DO APP
The Application list tasks that need to be completed, and organized in order of priority by giving the values to the Checkboxes
- Stay in Sync 
- Displaying Date
- Adding new TODO
- Changing the Status of TODO DONE FALSE -> TRUE (And reverse)
- CheckBox prioritazation of the TODOs for one session only!

# Note
The Idea behind adding login was to create new JSON to store users DATA and then sort the TODOs
With the help of Filter(), however, the attempts to do in that way failed

# Error and Problems List
- Usage of both pug and ejs for templating HTML markup failed as the main view engine was PUG
And the EJS files were not displayed by click on the specified a(href="...")
- Failed to get the Date to show it in the main pug (layout.pug)
- Failed to get the values of todo.description to UPDATE the inner text to "New"
- Failed to get the values of user ID to filter todos by the logined USER
